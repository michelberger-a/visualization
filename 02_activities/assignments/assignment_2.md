# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Your answer...
      Bad:  
      https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisugly/comments/1gwgk42/nationality_of_foreign_residents_in_south_korea/  
      I used ony of my favourite reddit pages to obtain this visual. Although I do like looking at maps, this visual is quite confusing. There is extraneous cognitive load because on initial view, I thought this was a map on Koreans living in other countries. The text does explain the purpose of the overall image. Although there is no direct connection between pie graphs, I believe this violates Gestalt's continuity principle. For a handful of countries, we have large pies with gender breakdowns but several countries have mono-coloured dots. I'd image some of those countries, despite the small Korean population, can provide a gendered-breakdown. Finally, this map has a highly detailed composition. There are many lines, colours for population, colours for gender, sizes and pies making the visual difficult to navigate and understand. There are too many elements incorporated into what should be a simpler visual.

      Good:

      I think this is a great visual because of the conciseness and simplicity of the image. First, the image uses a familiar chart type, reducing the overall cognitive load. The area graph is simple to comprehend and useful in depicting the market share of each browser. Second, from Gestalt, the data is all connected over time and connected to other browsers. These browsers are all similar and we create similar comparisons according to date over time. Finally, the visual is explanatory, rather than exploratory. With a straightforward approach, we can see immediately, this is a comparison of browser popularity without needing to dig for further information.
      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...
      Bad: One suggesstion to improve the visualization is to utilize a concise composition. There are too many dufferent legends to understand and too many components plotted over the map. Rather, a stacked bar chart which shows the number of male and female Koreans, broken down by country as another x-axis could simplify and still display a magnitude in difference. Second suggestion is to move away from the colour and pie elements as they require the reader to form an approximate interpretation. The colours all have ranges, yet the visual provides the count of Koreans in each country. A more exact number per gender per country would be easier than deciphering several legends.  

      Good: The colours of this visual are too similar and may be difficult to interpret for those with vision impairment. This may help with the perceived factual basis by keeping a cleaner layout through better colour design and also increase the objectivity of the image. Second, another improvement also includes the perceived factual basis would to have a better data source citation. The current source is just a link to w3 schools, whereas a link to the survey or collection of data would be more appropriate.      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
